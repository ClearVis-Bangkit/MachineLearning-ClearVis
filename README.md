# MachineLearning-ClearVis
Machine Learning Modelling Process for ClearVis Application
## About The Project 
This is Bangkit 2022 final project about Retinoblastoma detection as one of the requirements for graduation. 

What we are doing here is:
- Build The CNN model
- Creating retinoblastoma detection dataset
- Converting model to TFLite format

## How to Run the notebook
1. Open Retinoblastoma_Detection.ipynb in google colab
2. Change runtime type using GPU
3. Upload dataset from dataset folder in this repository

## Build With
This application model build with some technology, whice is:
- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tensorflow 2.7
- Google Colab
